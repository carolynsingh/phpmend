PHP COMMENTS
================

A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program.

Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.

Syntax for single-line comments :

.. code-block::

   <?php
   // This is a single-line comment

   # This is also a single-line comment
   ?>

Syntax for multiple-line comments :

.. code-block::

   <?php
   /*
   This is a multiple-lines comment block
   that spans over multiple
   lines
   */
   ?>
